This is a Pomodoro timer project implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features

* Timer display showing the minutes and seconds remaining.
* Start button to begin the timer.
* Reset button to stop the timer and reset it to 00:00.
* Different colors for work sessions and breaks.
* Checkmarks indicating completed work sessions.

## Usage
1. Click the "Start" button to start the timer.
2. The timer will count down the specified work duration (25 minutes by default).
3. After each work session, a break of 5 minutes (short break) or 10 minutes (long break) will be initiated.
4. The timer will cycle between work sessions and breaks until manually reset.
5. Click the "Reset" button to stop the timer and reset it to 00:00.
