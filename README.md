![Interesting](https://media.tenor.com/olrLtkAKZ7AAAAAM/wave-inside-out.gif)


This is a Pomodoro timer project implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 

I built this project only for fun hahahaha and just filling in my free time :relaxed:.
